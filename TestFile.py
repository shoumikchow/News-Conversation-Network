Barred from school for not paying three months fees, she has been sitting home for two months.\n\nThe school is not allowing her to attend classes since we have not been able to pay Tk900, Shabnams mother Baby Begum said.\n\nHer father Md Mokarram works at a small RMG business, making Tk3,000. Shabnam is his third child.\n\nAsked why she had not enrolled Shabnam to a government school, the dejected mother said: Because they ask for Tk300-400 for birth registration. Wed have to go without food for two days to pay that.\n\nIt was strange to hear that birth registration requires a payment, since the government issued an order last year telling authorities to register the births of slum and street children free of charge.\n\nBut a number of families besides Shabnams at New Kurmitola slum in Pallabi complained about the authorities charging money for the registration. The visit was organised by bssinfotainment, funded by World Vision and AusAID.\n\nThis correspondent met another 13-year-old named Md Mamun, who goes to a private school during the day and works at a small RMG factory at night.\n\nI work to pay my school fees and to collect the money for birth registration, he said.\n\nAccording to the local ward commissioners office, at least 10,000 families live in New Kurmitola slum, of whom nearly 1,000 are under 18.\n\nIt is not just education that is getting hampered because of this problem. Meherunnesa, another resident of the slum, said her daughter Sabihas marriage almost broke off two months ago because she did not have a birth registration number.\n\nThe grooms family left the ceremony when the kazi told us that the marriage cannot be registered without the bride and grooms birth registration numbers. Later, with the help of some NGO workers in our locality, my daughter got her birth registered on an urgent basis for Tk300 at the city corporation, she told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\nSuriya Zannat, child protection officer at World Vision, a charity organisation for children, said a number of children in the slum are dropping out of school because they cannot get birth registration number that the government schools ask for, and they cannot afford going to private schools.\n\nWe contacted local city corporation officials about this but did not get any response, she said.\n\nSazzad Hossain, Ward 2 councillor in Mirpur, said: There are no pending applications on my desk as I complete all formalities as soon as possible when residents of my area send in their applications.\n\nWhen the Dhaka Tribune contacted Md Nayeb Ali, zonal executive officer at Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) for Mirpur and Pallabi, he said birth registration was not his responsibility.\n\nThe Dhaka Tribune then contacted Dr Mahmuda Ali, the health officer at the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project of the DNCC. She admitted that there are indeed some problems regarding birth registration of street and slum children in her area.\n\nI recently joined my station here at Zone 2. There has been some complaints regarding the free birth registration, but I am working to sort them out. I have asked all the applicants to submit their documents for the registration. I will personally make sure that the registrations are done properly, she said.'"))
